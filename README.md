## **Requirements**

This package uses XML output from [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) to generate a documentation website for annotated C# code. See the [Getting started](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/starting.html) page on the Doxygen website for details on installing and running Doxygen.

It is worth noting that only the XML output is required to use the doxsite package, so all other forms of output can be ignored.

## **Manual**

### **Running Doxygen**

Before running Doxygen, ensure the following options are set in the Doxygen config:

```
GENERATE_XML        = YES
XML_PROGRAMLISTING  = YES
```

These options ensure the data required by the doxsite package will be generated.


### **HTML templates**

The website will be constructed using template HTML to build each page of documentation. Templates can be provided as individual text/html files or as raw strings. Each template may contain 1 or more variables that will be substuted by a `DocBuilder` object when the documentation site is built.

Templates are provided as an object with the properties listed below. Only the **page** property is required, it is up to the website author to decide on the structure of the page template and to make use of the other templates as required.
