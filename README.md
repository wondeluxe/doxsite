# **doxsite**

Utility for creating highly customised documentation websites with XML generated by Doxygen.

This package has been created with C# projects in mind. Doxygen is capable of producing data for a number of programming languages, however this package has not been tested with data from projects other than C#.

## **Requirements**

This package uses XML output from [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) to generate a documentation website for annotated C# code. See the [Getting started](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/starting.html) page on the Doxygen website for details on installing and running Doxygen.

It is worth noting that only the XML output is required to use the doxsite package, so all other forms of output can be ignored.

## **Installation**

It is recommended to install doxsite globally, so as to get access to the command line interface (CLI). The CLI will make creating new projects easier as well as give you the option to forego additional node scripts for building your documentation site.

To install globally:

```
$ npm install -g doxsite
```

If you would like to use the package in your node scripts after installing globally, you will need to link doxsite to your local project:

```
$ npm link doxsite
```


## **Getting started**

### **1. Create a new project**

The easiest way to get started is to use the command line interface to set up a default project. `cd` into the folder you wish to create your documentation in and run:

```
$ doxsite -n
```

This command will create the following folders/files:

| Folder/File                       | Description |
| --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| develop                           | Root folder for the documentation website's development. |
| develop/API                       | Output folder for documentation pages. |
| develop/scripts/nav.js            | Script responsible for nav tree functionality on each page of the site. Handles expand/collapse of namespaces and resizing of the nav tree column. |
| develop/styles/documentation.css  | Stylesheet for the website. |
| doxygen                           | Folder containing Doxygen related files. |
| doxygen/Doxyfile                  | The config file to use when running Doxygen. You will need to modify the `INPUT` option to point to your project. All other options will be configured to work with this folder/file structure. |
| doxygen/XML                       | Output directory for XML produced by Doxygen. Doxyfile points to this folder. |
| templates                         | Folder containing html templates to build the documentation pages with. |
| templates/tempaltes.json          | Template config file. Defines which html files to use for each section/element of a documentation page. |

### **2. Modify Doxygen input**

Next modify the `INPUT` option in the Doxyfile to point to the folders you want to generate documentation for. You can enter multiple paths separated by spaces, eg:

```
INPUT = "../Project/Company/Scripts" "../Project/Project/Scripts" "../Project/Some Other/Scripts"
```

By default the Doxyfile will have the `RECURSIVE` option set to `YES` so all sub folders will be traversed when Doxygen runs.

### **3. Run Doxygen**

If Doxygen is installed on the command line, run the following command:

```
$ doxygen doxygen/Doxyfile
```

The **doxygen/XML** folder will now contain the data needed by doxsite.

### **4. Run doxsite**

To run doxsite from the command line:

```
$ doxsite -x doxygen/XML -t templates/templates.json -o develop/API -a API
```

Or from a Node script:

```js
import { Doxsite } from 'doxsite';

Doxsite.buildDocs({
	xmlPath: 'doxygen/XML',
	templates: 'templates/templates.json',
	outputPath: 'develop/API',
	apiSubPath: 'API'
});
```

## **Site customisation**

doxsite generates a website by parsing the XML output of Doxygen and injecting that data into HTML templates. The templates use predefined variables (in the format `$variablename`) where content generated by doxsite should be inserted. This gives you near total control of the layout, styling and scripts used on each page.

### **templates.json**

The easiest way to supply template data is using a **templates.json** file that defines which files/content to use for each template. The default project created using `doxsite -n` provides a file that can be used as a reference under `templates/templates.json`.

A templates .json file should contain two root level properties:

| Property | Type   | Description |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| filePath | String | Path where templates files are located, relative to this json file. |
| files    | Object | Object where each property is the name of a template, and its value is the name of a file whose content to use. |

### **HTML templates**

The following table lists all valid template properties that can be provided in templates.json.

| Template                       | Description |

### **Template variables**

### **JavaScript**

#### **Doxsite.createProject([projectPath])**

```js
import { Doxsite } from 'doxsite';

Doxsite.createProject('./Documentation');
```

Create a new project at a specified path. Creates a 'doxygen' folder containing a Doxyfile and XML folder for Doxygen output, a 'develop' folder for the site with a default stylesheet and JavaScript, as well as a 'templates' folder, containing default html templates for building a documentation site.

**Parameters**

	templates: 'templates/templates.json',
	outputPath: 'develop/API',
	apiSubPath: 'API'
});
```

Build documentation files using previously generated xml from Doxygen. This method can be re-run on its own after modifiying template files to reduce build time.

**Parameters**

| Name           | Type   | Description |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------- |
| config         | Object | A [BuildConfig object](#buildconfig-object) defining the options to use for generation of the site. If omitted, the defaults defined by BuildConfig will be used. |

```

Run Doxygen on the command line.

**Parameters**

| Name     | Type   | Description |
| -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| doxyfile | String | Path to the Doxyfile. If no file is provided, Doxygen will attempt to run with a file named Doxyfile in the current working directory. |


#### **Doxsite.runBuild([doxyfile, buildConfig])**

```js
import { Doxsite } from 'doxsite';

Doxsite.runBuild('doxygen/Doxyfile', {
	xmlPath: 'doxygen/XML',
	templates: 'templates/templates.json',
	outputPath: 'develop/API',
	apiSubPath: 'API'

Run Doxygen from the command line and build the documentation site. This method calls `Doxsite.runDoxygen` and `Doxsite.buildDocs` in order.

**Parameters**

| Name        | Type   | Description |
